# BoW-Based-Neural-Networks-for-Text-Classification
This repository contains the code of our paper entitles "BoW-Based Neural Networks vs. Cutting-edge Models for Single-label Text Classification"
The models presented in this paper demonstrate that our simple models like (CNN, ANN, FT-CNN, and FT-ANN) can perform better than more complex GNN ones such as (SGC, SSGC, and TextGCN) and are comparable to others (i.e., HyperGAT and Bert).
